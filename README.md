# Weather-webapp

A front end weather forecast application will give the details of temperature,wind,cloud,pressure and humidity details for the next five days in any city.This application is built with html5,css3 and React js.The weather data is accessed through the Open Weather Map API.

# Installation :
     
     1.Both Git and Node.js need to be installed to run this development build.
     
     2.Using Node.js command prompt,go into the root folder.It contains client and server folder.
     
     3.Inside client folder,run the following command:
          
         npm install gulp
     
                 or

# Outcomes: 
    
      I feel that I have demonstrated the following:
    
      1.Basic of RESTfull API
    
      2.Implemented REACT JS and its concepts.
    
      3.Implemented Html5 and Css3.
    
    Given more time,I would like to demonstrate
   
        1.responsive design
    
        2.knowledge of testing.

I could have build this more better in Python flask as well. More responsive, storing data as export features, getting mobile notification using twillio api on weather changes, detecting current location and so on ..
